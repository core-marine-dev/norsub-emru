Library to read NMEA-like sentences of Norsub eMRU devices. It works same as [NMEA-Parser library](https://github.com/core-marine-dev/nmea-parser/) and it has the same API. The only nuance is it gives metadata of the device status if the sentence bring that info.

To understand how it works, please look the info of [NMEA-Parser library](https://github.com/core-marine-dev/nmea-parser/).

The complete output with metada it is showd below.
